Superb!
Now, recalling the basics of Garrey Goosey's character design and our aesthetics:
Drawn on wrinkled lined notebook paper
Drawn with a blue ballpoint pen
Awkwardly scrawled, as if done with a non-dominant hand
Sketched with a frenetic, manic energy
Anthropomorphic goose character
Wears jean shorts and a necktie
Loose feathers on the top of his head
Jagged teeth like saw blades in his beak
Wide, wild bloodshot eyes (the only use of red in the image being the veins of those eyes)
Please now draw:
Garrey Goosey playing chess in a park, looking very angry at the board.
