# Garrey Goosey

Garrey Goosey's character design and comic aesthetics:

* Drawn on wrinkled lined notebook paper.
* Drawn with a blue ballpoint pen
* Awkwardly scrawled, as if done with a non-dominant hand
* Sketched with a frenetic, manic energy
* Anthropomorphic goose character
* Wears jean shorts and a necktie
* Loose feathers on the top of his head
* Jagged teeth like saw blades in his beak
* Wide, wild bloodshot eyes

Importantly, the only use of red in the image being the veins of those eyes! Everything else is drawn with blue pen.
